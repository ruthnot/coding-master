[LeetCode: 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

[LintCode: 453 · Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://lintcode.com/problem/453 )

## Description 

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":



The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.

The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.



 

Example 1:





Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]



Example 2:



Input: root = []

Output: []



Example 3:



Input: root = [0]

Output: [0]



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        self.dfs(root)

    def dfs(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return None
        last_left = self.dfs(node.left)
        last_right = self.dfs(node.right)
        if last_left:
            last_left.right = node.right
            node.right = node.left
            node.left = None
        return last_right or last_left or node
 ``` 
## Notes
understand what to return at each level of the tree.
