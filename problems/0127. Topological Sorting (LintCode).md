## Description 

Description
Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
"""
class DirectedGraphNode:
     def __init__(self, x):
         self.label = x
         self.neighbors = []
"""
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    """
    @param graph: A list of Directed graph node
    @return: Any topological order for the given graph.
    """
    def topSort(self, graph):
        in_degree = {n: 0 for n in graph}
        for n in graph:
            for neighbor in n.neighbors:
                in_degree[neighbor] += 1
        result = []
        queue = deque([])
        for key, val in in_degree.items():
            if val == 0:
                queue.append(key)
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
            result.append(node)
        return result
 ``` 
## Notes
Remember class instance is hashable so you can directly use the grpah node provided in the in_degree dictionary.
