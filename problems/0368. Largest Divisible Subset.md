[LeetCode: 368. Largest Divisible Subset](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/)

[LintCode: 603 · Largest Divisible Subset](https://lintcode.com/problem/603 )

## Description 

Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:



answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or

answer[j] % answer[i] == 0



If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: [1,2]

Explanation: [1,3] is also accepted.



Example 2:



Input: nums = [1,2,4,8]

Output: [1,2,4,8]



 

Constraints:



1 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 109

All the integers in nums are unique.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def largestDivisibleSubset(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[x] for x in nums]
        for i in range(1, n):
            candidate = []
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0 and len(dp[j]) > len(candidate):
                    candidate = dp[j]
            dp[i][:0] = candidate
        return max(dp, key=len)
 ```
