[LeetCode: 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

[LintCode: 62 · Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://lintcode.com/problem/62 )

## Description 

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0

Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3

Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0

Output: -1



 

Constraints:



1 <= nums.length <= 5000

-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

All values of nums are unique.

nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.

-104 <= target <= 104



## Solution 
 ```python 
 
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        pivot = self.find_pivot(nums)

        if target > nums[-1]:
            left, right = 0, pivot - 1
        else:
            left, right = pivot, len(nums) - 1
        while left + 1 < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid
            else:
                right = mid
        if nums[left] == target:
            return left
        if nums[right] == target:
            return right
        return -1
            

    def find_pivot(self, nums):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left + 1 < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid
            else:
                right = mid
        return left if nums[left] < nums[right] else right

 ``` 
## Notes
Always trying to find the pivot (instead of Peak for example). Pivot indicates where the rotation happens, and works even
if there was no rotation. But peak will very likely to fail if no rotation happens without extra constraints.
