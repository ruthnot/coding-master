[LintCode: 533 · Two Sum - Closest to target](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/533/?_from=collection&fromId=161)

## Description 

Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.

Return the difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

 

Example 1:

Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 4.

The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def twoSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        # write your code here
        nums.sort()
        result = float('inf')
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            twoSum = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if twoSum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
            result = min(result, abs(twoSum - target))
        return result
 ``` 
## Notes
Almost the same as Two Sum, the only thing to notice is to return the minimumlly different result instead of the target itself.
