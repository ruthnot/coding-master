[LeetCode: 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

[LintCode: 384 · Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://lintcode.com/problem/384 )

## Description 

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.



Example 2:



Input: s = "bbbbb"

Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.



Example 3:



Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.



 

Constraints:



0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104

s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        count = set()
        res = float('-inf')
        right = 0
        for left in range(len(s)):
            while right < len(s) and s[right] not in count:
                count.add(s[right])
                right += 1
            
            res = max(res, len(count))
            count.remove(s[left])
        return res

 ``` 
## Notes
Simple size-changing window. Notice both set and dict for the count work, dict will be a little safer.
