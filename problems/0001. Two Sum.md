[LeetCode: 1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

[LintCode: 56 · Two Sum](https://lintcode.com/problem/56 )

## Description 

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].



Example 2:



Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6

Output: [1,2]



Example 3:



Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]



 

Constraints:



2 <= nums.length <= 104

-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

-109 <= target <= 109

Only one valid answer exists.



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Two Pointers
        pair = []
        for idx, val in enumerate(nums):
            pair.append((idx, val))
        pair.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        left, right = 0, len(pair) - 1
        while left < right:
            sum = pair[left][1] + pair[right][1]
            if sum < target:
                left += 1
            elif sum > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return [pair[left][0], pair[right][0]]
        return [-1, -1]
 ``` 
## Notes
The best solution of this problem is actually hashset, but it's a good problem for practicing two pointers. The trick here is to know how to
preserve indexes after sorting. Use tuple to store index before sorting is the key. Remember how to use lambda for sorting.
