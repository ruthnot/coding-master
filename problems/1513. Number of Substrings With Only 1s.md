[LeetCode: 1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-with-only-1s/)

[LintCode: 1870 · Number of Substrings with All Zeroes](https://lintcode.com/problem/1870 )

## Description 

Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "0110111"

Output: 9

Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.

"1" -> 5 times.

"11" -> 3 times.

"111" -> 1 time.

Example 2:



Input: s = "101"

Output: 2

Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.



Example 3:



Input: s = "111111"

Output: 21

Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.



 

Constraints:



1 <= s.length <= 105

s[i] is either '0' or '1'.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def numSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans, count = 0, 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '1':
                count += 1
                ans += count
            else:
                count = 0
        return ans % (10**9+7)
 ``` 
## Notes
Math problem, this solution is more of a pattern recognition. Notice the module at the end is to pass the test cases.
