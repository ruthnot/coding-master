[LeetCode: 312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/)

[LintCode: 168 · Burst Balloons](https://lintcode.com/problem/168 )

## Description 

You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]

Output: 167

Explanation:

nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []

coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

Example 2:



Input: nums = [1,5]

Output: 10



 

Constraints:



n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 300

0 <= nums[i] <= 100



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = [1, *nums, 1]
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for length in range(3, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], \
                                dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + nums[i] * nums[k] * nums[j])
        return dp[0][n-1]
 ``` 
## Notes
Hard DP, be careful on +1 and -1
