[LintCode: 1375 · Substring With At Least K Distinct Characters](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/1375/)

## Description 

Given a string S with only lowercase characters.

Return the number of substrings that contains at least k distinct characters

 

Example 1:

Input: S = "abcabcabca", k = 4

Output: 0

Explanation: There are only three distinct characters in the string.

Example 2:

Input: S = "abcabcabcabc", k = 3

Output: 55

Explanation: Any substring whose length is not smaller than 3 contains a, b, c.
    For example, there are 10 substrings whose length are 3, "abc", "bca", "cab" ... "abc"
    There are 9 substrings whose length are 4, "abca", "bcab", "cabc" ... "cabc"
    ...
    There is 1 substring whose length is 12, "abcabcabcabc"
    So the answer is 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55.

 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    """
    @param s: a string
    @param k: an integer
    @return: the number of substrings there are that contain at least k distinct characters
    """
    def k_distinct_characters(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Write your code here
        count = 0
        hashmap = {}
        i = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            hashmap[s[j]] = hashmap.get(s[j], 0) + 1
            while len(hashmap) == k and i <= j:
                count += len(s) - j
                hashmap[s[i]] -= 1
                if hashmap[s[i]] == 0:
                    del hashmap[s[i]]
                i += 1 
        return count
 ``` 
## Notes
Notice the line: count += len(s) - j, understand why it needs to do this to include all remaining subsets.
