[LeetCode: 1099. Two Sum Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/)

[LintCode: 609 Â· Two Sum - Less than or equal to target](https://lintcode.com/problem/609 )

## Description 
Given an array A of integers and integer K, return the maximum S such that there exists i < j with A[i] + A[j] = S and S < K. If no i, j exist satisfying this equation, return -1.

**Example 1:**

>Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60 \
>Output: 58 \
>Explanation: \
>We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.

**Example 2:**
>Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15\
>Output: -1\
>Explanation: \
>In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.\
 

**Note:**
>1 <= A.length <= 100\
>1 <= A[i] <= 1000\
>1 <= K <= 2000\
## Solution 
 ```python 
 class Solution:
    def twoSumLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        res = -1
        nums.sort()
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            twoSum = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if twoSum < k: 
                res = max(res, twoSum)
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return res
 ``` 
## Notes
Notice update max val only happens when twoSum < k.\
Also on leetcode, the problem is actually a little harder, instead of finding the max, it asks to find all.\
This is a bit tricky because while we're moving left and right pointer, there will be combinations we never will meet.\
The key here is once we find a pair, automatically add all pairs in the middle. Take a look at Legacy problem 609.
