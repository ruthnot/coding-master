[LeetCode: 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

[LintCode: 398 · Longest Ascent Path](https://lintcode.com/problem/398 )

## Description 

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

 

Example 1:





Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].



Example 2:





Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.



Example 3:



Input: matrix = [[1]]

Output: 1



 

Constraints:



m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 200

0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_val = 1
        n, m = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

        dp = [[1] * m for _ in range(n)]

        cells = dict()
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                cells[(i, j)] = matrix[i][j]
        
        cells = dict(sorted(cells.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))

        for (x, y), val in cells.items():
            for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if not (0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m):
                    continue
                if matrix[nx][ny] >= val:
                    continue
                dp[x][y] = max(dp[x][y], dp[nx][ny] + 1)
                if dp[x][y] > max_val:
                    max_val = dp[x][y]
        return max_val

 ``` 
## Notes
The hardest part is figure out the order to find the next cell. It's not by row or by column like other problems.
