[LeetCode: 444. Sequence Reconstruction](https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/)

[LintCode: 605 · Sequence Reconstruction](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/605/)

## Description 

Description
Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in seqs. The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 104. Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are subsequences of it). Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.

Example 1:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2],[1,3]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

[1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed, because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be reconstructed.

Example 2:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2]]

Output:

false

Explanation:

The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2].

Example 3:

Input:

org: [1,2,3], seqs: [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

Output:

true

Explanation:

The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct the original sequence [1,2,3].

Example 4:

Input:

org: [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs: [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]

Output:

true


 

## Solution 
 ```python 
from typing import (
    List,
)
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    """
    @param org: a permutation of the integers from 1 to n
    @param seqs: a list of sequences
    @return: true if it can be reconstructed only one or false
    """
    def sequence_reconstruction(self, org: List[int], seqs: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # write your code here
        # create graph
        graph = {}
        for seq in seqs:
            for node in seq:
                if node in graph:
                    continue
                graph[node] = set()
        for seq in seqs:
            for i in range(1, len(seq)):
                graph[seq[i - 1]].add(seq[i])
        # create in_degree
        in_degree = {x: 0 for x in graph}
        for node, neighbors in graph.items():
            for neighbor in neighbors:
                in_degree[neighbor] += 1
        # topo sort
        topo_seq = []
        queue = deque([])
        for node, degree in in_degree.items():
            if degree == 0:
                queue.append(node)
        while queue:
            if len(queue) > 1:
                return False
            node = queue.popleft()
            topo_seq.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return topo_seq == org
 ``` 
## Notes
The core of problem is easy once you figure out the algorithm which is topo sort. But the construction of graph and in_degree is very tricky.
Be careful to understand the ways of doing it correctly.
