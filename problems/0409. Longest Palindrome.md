[LeetCode: 409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

[LintCode: 627 · Longest Palindrome](https://lintcode.com/problem/627 )

## Description 

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "abccccdd"

Output: 7

Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.



Example 2:



Input: s = "a"

Output: 1

Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.



 

Constraints:



1 <= s.length <= 2000

s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        hashset = set()
        for c in s:
            if c in hashset:
                hashset.remove(c)
                count += 2
            else:
                hashset.add(c)
        return min(len(hashset), 1) + count
 ``` 
## Notes
Easy to solve, but be careful on what the problem wants to return.
