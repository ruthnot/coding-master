[LeetCode: 88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

[LintCode: 6 · Merge Two Sorted Arrays](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/6/)

## Description 

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].

The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.



Example 2:



Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0

Output: [1]

Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].

The result of the merge is [1].



Example 3:



Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1

Output: [1]

Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].

The result of the merge is [1].

Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.



 

Constraints:



nums1.length == m + n

nums2.length == n

0 <= m, n <= 200

1 <= m + n <= 200

-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109



 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        # Initialize nums1's index
        i = m - 1
        # Initialize nums2's index
        j = n - 1
        # Initialize a variable k to store the last index of the 1st array...
        k = m + n - 1
        while j >= 0:
            if i >= 0 and nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
                nums1[k] = nums1[i]
                k -= 1
                i -= 1
            else:
                nums1[k] = nums2[j]
                k -= 1
                j -= 1
 ``` 
## Notes
This is actually a really interesting problem because it requires in-place (creating a new array will be much easier).
First of all you can not swap any items otherwise they are not sorted anymore;
Then, if you start at the beginning of the array, each time you want to insert into nums1, it's a lot of work to change the rest of nums1
Therefore, a very efficient way is to start from the end of the array, this way you can replace all of the 0 without changing the rest of the array.
