[LeetCode: 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

[LintCode: 902 · Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://lintcode.com/problem/902 )

## Description 

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

 

Example 1:





Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1

Output: 1



Example 2:





Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3

Output: 3



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is n.

1 <= k <= n <= 104

0 <= Node.val <= 104



 

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        self.k = k
        ordered = self.dfs(root)
        return ordered[k-1]

    def dfs(self, node):
        if not node:
            return []
        l = self.dfs(node.left)
        if len(l) >= self.k:
            return l
        r = self.dfs(node.right)
        return l + [node.val] + r
 ``` 
## Notes
Can you solve using none-recursion?
