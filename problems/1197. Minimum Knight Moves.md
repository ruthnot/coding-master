[LeetCode: 1197. Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/)

[LintCode: 611 · Knight Shortest Path](https://lintcode.com/problem/611)

## Description 

In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 1

Output: 1

Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]

Example 2:

Input: x = 5, y = 5

Output: 4

Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]

Constraints:

|x| + |y| <= 300



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
 
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        dirs = [(-1, -2), (-2, -1), (1, -2), (2, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
        moves = -1
        queue = deque([(0, 0)])
        visited = {(0, 0)}
        while queue:
            moves += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                i, j = queue.popleft()
                if (i, j) == (x, y):
                    return moves
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    new_node = (i + di, j + dj)
                    if new_node not in visited:
                        visited.add(new_node)
                        queue.append(new_node)
        return -1    
 ``` 
## Notes
Very standard BFS problem. The one on Lintcode is slightly harder because it's not unlimited board.
