[LeetCode: 261. Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

[LintCode: 178 · Graph Valid Tree](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/178/)

## Description 

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
 write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

 For example:

 Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.

 Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.

 Hint:
 Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], what should your return?
    Is this case a valid tree?
 According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.
    In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”

 Note:
 you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges.
 Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.


 

## Solution 
 ```python 
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @param edges: a list of undirected edges
    @return: true if it's a valid tree, or false
    """

    def validTree(self, n, edges):
        # write your code here
        if len(edges) != n - 1:
            return False

        neighbors = {x: [] for x in range(n)}
        for x, y in edges:
            neighbors[x].append(y)
            neighbors[y].append(x)
        visited = {0}
        queue = deque([0])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in neighbors[node]:
                if neighbor in visited:
                    continue
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
        return len(visited) == n
 ``` 
## Notes
N nodes tree have n-1 edges. Even with n-1 edges, not guaranteed include all nodes. So this problem can be solved using BFS to scan through all edges and see if can reach all nodes.
