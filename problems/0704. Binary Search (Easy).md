[Leetcode: 704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

[Lintcode: 457. Classical Binary Search]()

## Problem
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**
> Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

**Example 2:**

>Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

**Constraints:**
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 104
2. -104 < nums[i], target < 104
3. All the integers in nums are unique.
4. nums is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left + 1 < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid
        if nums[left] == target:
            return left
        if nums[right] == target:
            return right
        return -1
```

## Notes
This is a very good Binary Search template. It can also be used by many other related problems.
such as find first match or last match index. Try to memorize it.
