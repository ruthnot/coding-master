[LeetCode: 354. Russian Doll Envelopes](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/)

[LintCode: 602 · Russian Doll Envelopes](https://lintcode.com/problem/602 )

## Description 

You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where envelopes[i] = [wi, hi] represents the width and the height of an envelope.

One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.

 

Example 1:



Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]

Output: 3

Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).



Example 2:



Input: envelopes = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]

Output: 1



 

Constraints:



1 <= envelopes.length <= 105

envelopes[i].length == 2

1 <= wi, hi <= 105



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        n = len(envelopes)
        dp = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if envelopes[i][1] > envelopes[j][1]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        return max(dp)
 ``` 
## Notes
Trick is know how to sort the sequence to transform into a LIS problem.
Notice this solution won't pass OA, need to learn binary search method which is in one of the videos.
