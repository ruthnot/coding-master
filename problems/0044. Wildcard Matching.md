[LeetCode: 44. Wildcard Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/)

[LintCode: 192 · Wildcard Matching](https://lintcode.com/problem/192 )

## Description 

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:



'?' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).



The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "aa", p = "a"

Output: false

Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".



Example 2:



Input: s = "aa", p = "*"

Output: true

Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.



Example 3:



Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"

Output: false

Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.



 

Constraints:



0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000

s contains only lowercase English letters.

p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        n, m = len(s), len(p)
        dp = [[False] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = True

        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and p[j - 1] == '*'

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if p[j - 1] == '*':
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i][j - 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and \
                    (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '?')
        return dp[n][m]
 ``` 
## Notes
Hard DP problem, pretty tricky on "*" situation.
