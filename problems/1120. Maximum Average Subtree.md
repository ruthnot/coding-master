[LeetCode: 1120. Maximum Average Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subtree/)

[LintCode: 597 Â· Subtree with Maximum Average](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/597/?_from=collection&fromId=161 )

## Description 

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

 (A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants.
 The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)


 Example 1:

 Input: [5,6,1]

 Output: 6.00000

 Explanation:

     For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
     For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
     For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
     So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.


 Note:

     The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 5000.
     Each node will have a value between 0 and 100000.
     Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_ave = float('-inf')
        self.max_node = None
        
    def find_node(self, root):
        self.ave(root)
        return self.max_node
        
    def ave(self, root):
        total, count = root.val, 1
        if root.left:
            l_total, l_count = self.ave(root.left)
            total += l_total
            count += l_count
        if root.right:
            r_total, r_count = self.ave(root.right)
            total += r_total
            count += r_count
        ave_val = total/count
        if ave_val > self.max_ave:
            self.max_ave = ave_val
            self.max_node = root
        return total, count

n1 = TreeNode(1)
n2 = TreeNode(-5)
n3 = TreeNode(11)
n4 = TreeNode(1)
n5 = TreeNode(2)
n6 = TreeNode(4)
n7 = TreeNode(-2)

n1.left = n2
n1.right = n3
n2.left = n4
n2.right = n5
n3.left = n6
n3.right = n7

x = Solution()
ans = x.find_node(n1)
print(ans.val)
 ``` 
## Notes
Current solution not neat enough.
