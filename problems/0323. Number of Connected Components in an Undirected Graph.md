[LeetCode: 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)
[LintCode: 431 · Connected Component in Undirected Graph](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/431/)

## Description 

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

Example 2:

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 





 

## Solution 
 ```python 
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        components = 0
        # build graph
        graph = {node: [] for node in range(n)}
        for node1, node2 in edges:
            graph[node1].append(node2)
            graph[node2].append(node1)
        # BFS
        visited = set()
        for node in graph:
            if node in visited:
                continue
            components += 1
            visited.add(node)
            queue = deque([node])
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor in visited:
                        continue
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return components
 ```
