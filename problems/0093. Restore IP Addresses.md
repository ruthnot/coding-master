[LeetCode: 93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

[LintCode: 426 · Restore IP Addresses](https://lintcode.com/problem/426 )

## Description 

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.



For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.



Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "25525511135"

Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]



Example 2:



Input: s = "0000"

Output: ["0.0.0.0"]



Example 3:



Input: s = "101023"

Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]



 

Constraints:



1 <= s.length <= 20

s consists of digits only.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def restoreIpAddresses(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        results = []
        self.dfs(s, 0, [], results)
        return results

    def dfs(self, string, start, result, results):
        if len(result) == 4:
            if start != len(string):
                return
            results.append('.'.join(result))
            return

        for i in range(1, 4):
            end = start + i
            if end > len(string):
                continue
            substring = string[start:end]

            if len(substring) > 1 and substring.startswith('0'):
                break
            val = int(substring)
            if not (0 <= val <= 255):
                break
            result.append(substring)
            self.dfs(string, end, result, results)
            result.pop()
 ``` 
## Notes
DFS problem, pay attention on how index (start and end) moves, and their boundaries.
