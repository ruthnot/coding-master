[LeetCode: 5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

[LintCode: 200 · Longest Palindromic Substring](https://lintcode.com/problem/200 )

## Description 

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "babad"

Output: "bab"

Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.



Example 2:



Input: s = "cbbd"

Output: "bb"



 

Constraints:



1 <= s.length <= 1000

s consist of only digits and English letters.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        max_len = 0
        max_i = None
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = 1
            max_len = 1
            max_i = i
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                dp[i][i+1] = 2
                max_len = 2
                max_i = i

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1] > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
                if dp[i][j] > max_len:
                    max_len = dp[i][j]
                    max_i = i

        return s[max_i:max_i+max_len]
 ``` 
## Notes
Besides figuring out the correct state function, the most tricky part is
the direction of for loop for i. Since dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1], looping i
should be from right to left (hence you will have i+1 first), and looping
j should from left to right (hence you will have j-1 first).
