[LeetCode: 16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

[LintCode: 59 · 3Sum Closest](https://lintcode.com/problem/59 )

## Description 

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1

Output: 2

Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).



Example 2:



Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1

Output: 0

Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).



 

Constraints:



3 <= nums.length <= 500

-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

-104 <= target <= 104



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        ans = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while left < right:
                three_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                if abs(ans - target) > abs(three_sum - target):
                    ans = three_sum
                if three_sum < target:
                    left += 1
                elif three_sum > target:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    return three_sum
        return ans
 ``` 
## Notes
Tricker than expeccted, the key is to fix one num every loop, and then from that number beyond do a 2 sum.
