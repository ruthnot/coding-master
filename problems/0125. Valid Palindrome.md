[LeetCode: 125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

[LintCode: 415 · Valid Palindrome](https://lintcode.com/problem/415 )

## Description 

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:



Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

Output: true

Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.



Example 2:



Input: s = "race a car"

Output: false

Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.



Example 3:



Input: s = " "

Output: true

Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.

Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.



 

Constraints:



1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105

s consists only of printable ASCII characters.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if not s[left].isalnum():
                left += 1
                continue
            if not s[right].isalnum():
                right -= 1
                continue
            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
 ``` 
## Notes
Inside the while loop, use if-continue instead of additional while loop because each while loop you need to check left <= right, which is already contolled by the outside while loop.
Use if-continue to avoid duplicate while loop check.
