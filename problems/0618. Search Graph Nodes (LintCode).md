## Description 

Given a undirected graph, a node and a target, return the nearest node to given node which value of it is target, return NULL if you can't find.
There is a mapping store the nodes' values in the given parameters.
Example

Example 1:

Input:
{1,2,3,4#2,1,3#3,1#4,1,5#5,4}

[3,4,5,50,50]

1

50

Output: 4

Explanation:

2------3  5
 \     |  | 
  \    |  |
   \   |  |
    \  |  |
      1 --4

Give a node 1, target is 50

there a hash named values which is [3,4,10,50,50], represent:

Value of node 1 is 3

Value of node 2 is 4

Value of node 3 is 10

Value of node 4 is 50

Value of node 5 is 50

Return node 4

Example 2:

Input:

{1,2#2,1}

[0,1]

1

1

Output:
2
 

## Solution 
 ```python 
"""
Definition for a undirected graph node
class UndirectedGraphNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.label = x
        self.neighbors = []
"""

from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def searchNode(self, graph, values, node, target):
        queue = deque([node])
        visited = {node}
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if values[node] == target:
                return node
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)
        return None

 ``` 
## Notes
Very easy BFS. Probably remove from list
