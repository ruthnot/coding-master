[LeetCode: 254. Factor Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/factor-combinations)

[LintCode: 652 Â· Factorization](https://lintcode.com/problem/652 )

## Description 

Description
A non-negative numbers can be regarded as product of its factors.

Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.


## Solution 
 ```python 
from typing import (
    List,
)

class Solution:
    """
    @param n: An integer
    @return: a list of combination
             we will sort your return value in output
    """
    def get_factors(self, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # write your code here
        factors = [x for x in range(2, n)]
        results = []
        self.dfs(results, [], factors, 0, n)
        return results

    def dfs(self, results, result, factors, index, remain):
        if remain == 1 and len(result) > 1:
            results.append(result[:])
            return 
            
        for i in range(index, len(factors)):
            factor = factors[i]
            if remain < factor:
                return
            if remain % factor != 0:
                continue
            result.append(factor)
            self.dfs(results, result, factors, i, remain // factor)
            result.pop()
 ``` 
## Notes
Solution is correct but too slow for all test cases. Leetcode maybe fine, but since it's
premium, need to revisit in the future
