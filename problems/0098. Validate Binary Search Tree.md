[LeetCode: 98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

[LintCode: 95 · Validate Binary Search Tree](https://lintcode.com/problem/95 )

## Description 

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:



The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



 

Example 1:





Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: true



Example 2:





Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]

Output: false

Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1



## Solution 
 ```python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        res, _, _ = self.dfs(root)
        return res

    def dfs(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return True, None, None
        is_left, min_left, max_left = self.dfs(node.left)
        is_right, min_right, max_right = self.dfs(node.right)
        
        if not (is_left and is_right):
            return False, None, None
        if max_left and not (max_left.val < node.val):
            return False, None, None
        if min_right and not (node.val < min_right.val):
            return False, None, None

        min_node = node if min_left is None else min_left
        max_node = node if max_right is None else max_right

        return True, min_node, max_node
 ``` 
## Notes
A little trickier than it looks.
