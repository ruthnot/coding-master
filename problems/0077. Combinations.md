[LeetCode: 77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)

[LintCode: 152 · Combinations](https://lintcode.com/problem/152 )

## Description 

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 4, k = 2

Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]

Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.

Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.



Example 2:



Input: n = 1, k = 1

Output: [[1]]

Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.



 

Constraints:



1 <= n <= 20

1 <= k <= n



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        array = [x for x in range(1, n+1)]
        results = []
        self.dfs(array, 0, results, [], k)
        return results


    def dfs(self, array, index, results, result, k):
        if len(result) == k:
            results.append(list(result))
            return
        for i in range(index, len(array)):
            result.append(array[i])
            self.dfs(array, i + 1, results, result, k)
            result.pop()
 ``` 
## Notes
A very good rudimental DFS problem to practice
