[LeetCode: 876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

[LintCode: 228 · Middle of Linked List](https://lintcode.com/problem/228 )

## Description 

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:





Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [3,4,5]

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.



Example 2:





Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: [4,5,6]

Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

1 <= Node.val <= 100



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head):
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
 ``` 
## Notes
Easy problem, key is to understand slow and fast pointers. Slow moves 1 step and fast moves 2 steps everytime.
When fast stops, slow is at the middle. However, be careful on even numbers, this problem ask to stop at the second middle, try
think about what need to be changed if ask stop at the first middle.
