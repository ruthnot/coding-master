[LeetCode: 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

[LintCode: 406 · Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://lintcode.com/problem/406 )

## Description 

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 

Example 1:



Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.



Example 2:



Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]

Output: 1



Example 3:



Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Output: 0



 

Constraints:



1 <= target <= 109

1 <= nums.length <= 105

1 <= nums[i] <= 104



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        min_len = float('inf')
        num_sum = 0
        right = 0
        for left in range(len(nums)):
            while num_sum < target and right < len(nums):
                num_sum += nums[right]
                right += 1
            if num_sum >= target:
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left)
            num_sum -= nums[left]
        return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else 0
 ``` 
## Notes
Be careful when adding the min length, it only when the num_sum >= target, otherwise when right reaching end, left is always moving and the length is always decreasing, hence final answer will always be 1.
Also, notice right always rest at the number that is not accounted, that's why the length of the subarray is right - left instead of right - left + 1.
