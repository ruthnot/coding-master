[LeetCode: 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)

[LintCode: 386 · Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://lintcode.com/problem/386 )

## Description 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

 


Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2 

Output: 3

Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

 


Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

## Solution 
 ```python 
 class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if not s or k == 0:
            return 0
        res = float('-inf')
        right = 0
        freq = {}
        for left in range(len(s)):
            while right < len(s) and (len(freq) < k or s[right] in freq):
                c = s[right]
                freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1
                right += 1
            
            res = max(res, right - left)

            c = s[left]
            freq[c] -= 1
            if freq[c] == 0:
                del freq[c]
        return res

 ``` 
## Notes
This is a very good question that requires many careful pointer manipulations. The important feedback here is to move right first; then check answers; then move left.
Also when move right, move at the end of every while loop, then check at the beginning.
