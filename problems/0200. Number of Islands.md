[LeetCode: 200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

[LintCode: 433 · Number of Islands](https://lintcode.com/problem/433 )

## Description 

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [

  ["1","1","1","1","0"],

  ["1","1","0","1","0"],

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["0","0","0","0","0"]

]

Output: 1



Example 2:



Input: grid = [

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["0","0","1","0","0"],

  ["0","0","0","1","1"]

]

Output: 3



 

Constraints:



m == grid.length

n == grid[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 300

grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        res = 0
        visited = set()
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if i == 2 and j == 2:
                    print((2, 2) in visited)
                if grid[i][j] == "1" and (i, j) not in visited:
                    res += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j, visited)
        return res

    def dfs(self, grid, x, y, visited):
        if (x, y) in visited:
            return
        visited.add((x, y))
        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if not self.is_valid(grid, nx, ny):
                continue
            self.dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited)

    def is_valid(self, grid, x, y):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if not (0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n):
            return False
        return grid[x][y] == "1"
 ``` 
## Notes
DFS problem. Walk through each tile, if not visited, that means it's the start of a new island. Use DFS to find all other tiles belong to the same island.
Notice, value in the tile is str, not int.
