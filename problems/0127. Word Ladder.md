[LeetCode: 127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

[LintCode: 120 · Word Ladder](https://lintcode.com/problem/120 )

## Description 

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:



Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.

Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.

sk == endWord



Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:



Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.



Example 2:



Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.



 

Constraints:



1 <= beginWord.length <= 10

endWord.length == beginWord.length

1 <= wordList.length <= 5000

wordList[i].length == beginWord.length

beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

beginWord != endWord

All the words in wordList are unique.



## Solution 
 ```python 
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        wordSet = set(wordList)
        step = 0
        queue = deque([beginWord])
        visited = set([beginWord])
        while queue:
            step += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                word = queue.popleft()
                if word == endWord:
                    return step
                next_words = self.find_next(word, wordSet)
                for new_word in next_words:
                    if new_word in visited:
                        continue
                    visited.add(new_word)
                    queue.append(new_word)
        return 0


    def find_next(self, word, wordList):
        words = []
        for i in range(len(word)):
            left, mid, right = word[:i], word[i], word[i+1:]
            for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                if char == mid:
                    continue
                candidate = left + char + right
                if candidate in wordList:
                    words.append(candidate)
        return words        
 ``` 
## Notes
The problem itself isn't hard, but you need to write the correct helper function, and also make the list into set for faster query.
Otherwise it will timeout for large test set
