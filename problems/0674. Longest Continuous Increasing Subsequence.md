[LeetCode: 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

[LintCode: 397 · Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://lintcode.com/problem/397 )

## Description 

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]

Output: 3

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.

Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element

4.



Example 2:



Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 1

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly

increasing.



 

Constraints:



1 <= nums.length <= 104

-109 <= nums[i] <= 109



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max = 1
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
                if dp[i] > max:
                    max = dp[i]
        return max
 ```
