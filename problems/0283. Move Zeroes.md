[LeetCode: 283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

[LintCode: 539 · Move Zeroes](https://lintcode.com/problem/539 )

## Description 

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]

Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]

Output: [0]



 

Constraints:



1 <= nums.length <= 104

-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        l, r = 0, 0
        while r < len(nums):
            if nums[r]:
                nums[l] = nums[r]
                l += 1
            r += 1
        for i in range(l, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0

 ``` 
## Notes
This solution has two iterations. 1st iteration use pointer r to identify all non-zero numbers and pointer l will have that value.
2nd iteration make all numbers after l becomes 0. Since the problem requested maintaining the relevant order, we cannot swap start and end.
During the process there maybe duplicate numbers but that's ok, all non-zero number will be put in the front of the list.
