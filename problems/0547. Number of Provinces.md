[LeetCode: 547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

[LintCode: 1179 · Friend Circles](https://lintcode.com/problem/1179 )

## Description 

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

 

Example 1:





Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]

Output: 2



Example 2:





Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]

Output: 3



 

Constraints:



1 <= n <= 200

n == isConnected.length

n == isConnected[i].length

isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.

isConnected[i][i] == 1

isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        res = 0
        visited = set()
        for i in range(len(isConnected)):
            if i not in visited:
                res += 1
                self.dfs(isConnected, i, visited)
        return res 
        
    def dfs(self, grid, i, visited):
        if i in visited:
            return
        visited.add(i)
        for j in range(len(grid)):
            if i == j or j in visited or not grid[i][j]:
                continue
            self.dfs(grid, j, visited)
 ``` 
## Notes
DFS problem, similar to number of islands. Only difference is how to search neighbors.
