[LeetCode: 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

[LintCode: 155 · Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://lintcode.com/problem/155 )

## Description 

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:





Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 2



Example 2:



Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

Output: 5



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000



## Solution 
 ```python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        queue = deque([root])
        count = 0
        while queue:
            count += 1
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                if not node.left and not node.right:
                    return count
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
        return count
 ```
