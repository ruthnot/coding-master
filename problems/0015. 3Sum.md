[LeetCode: 15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

[LintCode: 57 · 3Sum](https://lintcode.com/problem/57 )

## Description 

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]

Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Explanation: 

nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.

nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.

nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.

The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.



Example 2:



Input: nums = [0,1,1]

Output: []

Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.



Example 3:



Input: nums = [0,0,0]

Output: [[0,0,0]]

Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.



 

Constraints:



3 <= nums.length <= 3000

-105 <= nums[i] <= 105



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        results = []
        nums.sort()
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            if idx > 0 and num == nums[idx-1]:
                continue
            left = idx + 1
            right = len(nums) - 1
            self.twoSum(nums, left, right, -num, results)

        return results


    def twoSum(self, nums, left, right, target, results):
        while left < right:
            two_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if two_sum < target:
                left += 1
            elif two_sum > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                results.append([nums[left], nums[right], -target])
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                while left < right and left > 0 and nums[left] == nums[left-1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and right < len(nums) - 1 and nums[right] == nums[right+1]:
                    right -= 1 

 ``` 
## Notes
Basically a more advanced version of 2sum. The hard part is how to avoid duplicate answers. Couple of things need to know:
1. Only choose the same number as target once
2. Once target is chosen, only search nums after the target (cuz  anything before has already been a target)
3. Once found an answer pair, don't stop because there maybe other pairs using the same target, keep going but ignoring same values (hence the 2 while loops at the end)
