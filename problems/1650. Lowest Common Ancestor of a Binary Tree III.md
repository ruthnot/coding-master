[LeetCode: 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/)

[LintCode: 578 · Lowest Common Ancestor III](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/578/?_from=collection&fromId=161)

## Description 

Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}




 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].

-109 <= Node.val <= 109

All Node.val are unique.

p != q

p and q will exist in the tree.



## Solution 
 ```python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x, parent_node):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
#         self.parent = parent_node

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        p_copy, q_copy = p, q
        while p_copy != q_copy:
            p_copy = p_copy.parent if p_copy else q
            q_copy = q_copy.parent if q_copy else p
        return p_copy
 ``` 
## Notes
Pretty tricky algorithm, need to memorize.
