[LeetCode: 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

[LintCode: 165 · Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://lintcode.com/problem/165 )

## Description 

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

 

Example 1:





Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]



Example 2:



Input: list1 = [], list2 = []

Output: []



Example 3:



Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]

Output: [0]



 

Constraints:



The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.



## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode()
        head = dummy

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                head.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                head.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            head = head.next
        if list1:
            head.next = list1
        if list2:
            head.next = list2

        return dummy.next
 ``` 
## Notes
The key is to set a dummy head, and return dummy.next as the answer. ALso, after the while loop,
if any list is not empty, just point head.next to that node, no need to go through all the list.
