[LintCode: 443 · Two Sum - Greater than target](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/433/)

## Description 

Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is bigger than a specific target number. Please return the number of pairs.

 

Example 1:

Given numbers =[2, 7, 11, 15], target =24. \
Return1. (11 + 15 is the only pair)





 

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def twoSum2(self, nums, target):
        # write your code here
        nums.sort()
        res = 0
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            twoSum = nums[left] + nums[right]
            if twoSum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                res += right - left
                right -= 1
        return res
 ``` 
## Notes
Similar to the Lintcode version of 1099-Two Sum Less than K. Check out legacy 609
