[LeetCode: 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

[LintCode: 76 · Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://lintcode.com/problem/76 )

## Description 

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

 

Example 1:



Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.



Example 2:



Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]

Output: 4



Example 3:



Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]

Output: 1



 

Constraints:



1 <= nums.length <= 2500

-104 <= nums[i] <= 104



 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

## Solution 
 ```python 
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            candidates = [0]
            for j in range(1, i):
                if nums[j - 1] < nums[i - 1]:
                    candidates.append(dp[j])
            dp[i] = max(candidates) + 1
        return max(dp)
 ``` 
## Notes
Looks hard, but surprisingly easy
