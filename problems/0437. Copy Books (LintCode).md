[LintCode: 437 · Copy Books](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/437/)

## Description 

Given n books and the i-th book has pages[i] pages. There are k persons to copy these books.

These books list in a row and each person can claim a continous range of books. For example, one copier can copy the books from i-th to j-th continously, but he can not copy the 1st book, 2nd book and 4th book (without 3rd book).

They start copying books at the same time and they all cost 1 minute to copy 1 page of a book. What's the best strategy to assign books so that the slowest copier can finish at earliest time?

Return the shortest time that the slowest copier spends.



 

## Solution 
 ```python 
"""
class Solution:
    """
    @param pages: an array of integers
    @param k: An integer
    @return: an integer
    """
    def copy_books(self, pages: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # write your code here
        if not pages or not k:
            return 0
        n = len(pages)
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + pages[i - 1]
        
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(k + 1):
            dp[0][i] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, k + 1):
                for prev in range(i):
                    cost = prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[prev]
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], max(dp[prev][j - 1], cost))

        return dp[n][k]
 ``` 
## Notes
This is a pretty hard problem. Solution won't pass test cases because only binary search is fast enough.
However, this problem is good to practice DP. Try to understand the setup.
